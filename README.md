System Requirements
Python 3.11.2 or higher
Poetry - Python project dependency manager
NodeJS and NPM - tested on 18.17.0
Paid OpenAI API key (ChaCha uses GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models internally).
How To Run
Installation
In the root directory, install dependencies using poetry.
> poetry install
Install frontend Node dependencies
> cd frontend
> npm install
> cd ..
Run the setup script and follow the steps. It would help if you prepared the OpenAI API Key ready.
> poetry run python setup.py
Testing Chatbot on Command Line
Run chat.py on the command line:
> poetry run python chat.py
Testing Chatbot on Web
Running in development mode
Run backend server

> poetry run python main.py
The default port is 8000. You can set --port to designate manually.

> poetry run python main.py --port 3000
Run frontend server

The frontend is implemented with React in TypeScript. The development server is run on Parcel.

> cd frontend
> npm install <-- Run this to install dependencies 
> npm run dev
Access http://localhost:8888 on web browser.

You can perform the above steps using a shell script:

> sh ./run-web-dev.sh
Running in production mode
The backend server can serve the frontend web under the hood via the same port. To activate this, build the frontend code once:

> cd frontend
> npm run build
Then run the backend server:

> cd ..
> poetry run python main.py --production --port 80
Access http://localhost on web browser.

Analysis of Chat Logs
Chat Session Reviewing on Web
A session chat can be reviewed by visiting [domain]/share/{session_id}. There, you can also download the chat logs in CSV.

Log Files
To keep the framework lightweight, ChaCha leverages a file storage instead of a database. The session information and chat messages are stored in ./data/sessions/{session_name} in real time.

In the session directory, info.json maintains the metadata and the global configuration of the current session. For example:

{
  "id": "User_001",
  "turns": 1,
  "response_generator": {
    "state_history": [
      [
        "explore",
        null
      ]
    ],
    "verbose": false,
    "payload_memory": {},
    "user_name": "John",
    "user_age": 12,
    "locale": "kr"
  }
}
In the same location, dialogue.jsonl keeps the list of chat messages in a format of JsonLines, where each message is formatted as a single-lined json object.
